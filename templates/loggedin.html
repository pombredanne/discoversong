    Welcome $name!
    $message
    <p>
      Send an email to <font style="color: green; font-size: larger;">$to_address</font> with an artist and song title
      in the subject.  discoversong will search Rdio and add what it finds to the playlist you have selected below.
      It's great!  Give it a try.  You can also configure your music-identifying app like Shazam or VCast Song ID to
      send emails to discoversong.
